Portal
=====

This is the old Portal source code ported to Source Engine 2013.

## Dependencies

### Windows
* [Visual Studio 2013 with Update 5](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)

### macOS
* [Xcode 5.0.2](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/more)

### Linux
* GCC 4.8
* [Steam Client Runtime](http://media.steampowered.com/client/runtime/steam-runtime-sdk_latest.tar.xz)

I currently added only VS Project files, so if you want to compile for Linux or mac, you'll need to edit VPC files. I'll probably add proper VPC files later
## Building

Compiling process is the same as for Source SDK 2013. Instructions for building Source SDK 2013 can be found here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013

You will need to copy assets from your copy of Portal though

## Installing:

Same as Source SDK 2013 mod: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Setup_mod_on_steam
